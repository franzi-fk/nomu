# Nomu

A minimalist web app built with **Vue 3 + Vite**, focusing on a looped timer with some customization options. The primary goal of this project was to provide a playground for experimenting with **Tailwind CSS** while keeping the core functionality simple but useful.

## Features

- **Looped Timer** – Set up a repeating timer, perfect for gentle reminders (e.g., take a sip of water every x minutes)
- **Personalized Experience** – Tailor the look and feel of the app to your style:
  - Choose from **4 unique notification sounds**
  - Switch between **10 color themes** (5 light + 5 dark)
  - Pick from **4 background images** for extra flair
